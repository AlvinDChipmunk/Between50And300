# Between50And300
This is the assignment for Week 2 of the Java boot camp

Coding assignment: 
/**
 * Java Coding Bootclass Assignment:
 * Between 50 and 300 (no error handling)
 * version 1.00
 * 
 * In this command line program, the app asks the user to type in 
 * a number between 50 and 300.  It is expected that the input will
 * be both completely numeric and a whole number (no decimals or 
 * fractions).  If the user complies by giving a value between 50 
 * and 300, the output would be "Yes".  However, if instead the user 
 * gives a whole number value outside that range, the computers's 
 * output will be "No".  
 * 
 * Assignment recommendations include: 
 * 
 * - Integer.parseInt(stringValue), to translate the string to an Integer object
 * - a Scanner object, to collect input
 * 
 * Possible other tools: 
 * 
 * - Integer.intValue(), to get the actual int value for the range comparison
 * 
 * String input = scanner.nextLine();
 * Integer convertedInput = Integer.parseInt(input);
 *
